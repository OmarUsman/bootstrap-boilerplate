🚀 Bootstrap Boilerplate 🚀
**By: Omar Usman 🙃**

# What does this include?

  This Bootstrap boilerplate **comes with**:
	  
 - [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) (Always updated to the latest stable release but in this case its the v5 alpha)
 - [Popper.js](https://github.com/popperjs/popper-core) (Also always latest version)
 - [Feather Icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather)

We also include some **important folders** you might need while developing such as:

 - CSS
 - JS
 - Images
 - Fonts

We also use **SASS** to make CSS 100x easier but using it is your choice.
